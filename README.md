# My NeoVim Personal Dev Env Config

Config for my personal use.
While creating the config I had following things in mind:
* Don't complicate where not required, try to find a more simpler solution
* Minimal configuration. Use neovim and not plugins. This following the above rule.
* Its my config so like most configs out there I have control on what I have installed therefore no unnecessary checks
